The data that is in this folder was first extracted from this website (https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/amtrak-stations/explore?location=39.528931%2C-90.323756%2C5.00)

We did not get the coordiantes from this but we were able to put the addresses into google sheets and format them to be used in conversion with coordiantes.

We then used a tool to convert all of the addresses into coordinates that appear in the file in the folder (train_data.csv).

After all of this, we have a list of all of the Amtrack train stations in the US that can be used with their coordiantes and find their connecting stations.
